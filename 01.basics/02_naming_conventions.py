# Naming variable

# 1. it should allow only alpha numeric (a-zA-Z0-9), 1 special char (_)
# 2. 1st character shouldn't be a number, but underscore will be allowed.
# 3. any other special char instead of _ will give error.
# 4. keywords shouldn't be used to declare a variable
# await = "I am good"


# when ever we are declaring a variable a we follow snake_case
